Turi Create Visualization allows you to create, view, and save Plot objects. 
The Plot class is used to create an immutable object representation of a 
visualization and has the following methods:
- `show`: A method for displaying the Plot object.
- `save`: A method for saving the Plot object in a vega representation.

Turi Create Visualization also allows you to call `show` 
on data sources like SFrames and SArrays:

- `show`: Plots the data in `x` on the X axis and the data in `y` on the Y axis
          in a 2d visualization, and shows the resulting visualization.
          Uses a heuristic to choose the visualization, described in the API 
          documentation. 
          This show method supports SArrays of dtypes: int, float, str.

Furthermore, Turi Create provides functionality to create independent plots 
like scatter plots, categorical heatmaps, box plots, heatmaps, 
columnwise summaries, and item frequency plots using the following API:

- scatter(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- categorical_heatmap(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- heatmap(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- box_plot(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- columnwise_summary(sf)
- histogram(sa, xlabel, ylabel, title)
- item_frequency(sa, xlabel, ylabel, title)

To know more, please see the API docs at https://apple.github.io/turicreate/docs/api/
